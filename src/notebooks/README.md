# Data Profiling, Cleaning & Analysis

This repository contains notebooks for analyzing solar datasets from different countries. The notebooks guide users through **data inspection, cleaning, outlier detection, and visual analysis**, while leveraging modular scripts for tasks such as data loading, summary statistics, outlier handling, dataset cleaning, and visualization generation.

The project emphasizes **reusability and clarity**: notebooks focus on insights and observations, while the scripts handle computation and plotting. This structure allows the workflow to be easily applied to multiple countries or datasets without rewriting code.
