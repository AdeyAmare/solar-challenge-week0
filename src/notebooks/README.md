# Data Profiling, Cleaning & Analysis

This repository contains notebooks and reusable scripts for analyzing solar datasets for different countries. The notebooks guide users through data inspection, cleaning, outlier handling, and visual analysis step by step, while the scripts provide modular functions for loading data, computing summary statistics, handling outliers, cleaning datasets, and generating visualizations.

The design emphasizes reusability and clarity: notebooks focus on observations and insights, while scripts handle the computational and plotting tasks. This setup allows easy application to multiple countries or datasets without rewriting code.
