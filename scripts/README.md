# Scripts Overview

The `scripts` folder contains modular Python functions for data preparation, cleaning, and analysis. These scripts handle tasks such as loading datasets, computing summary statistics, managing outliers, and generating visualizations. By using these scripts, the same workflow can be easily applied to multiple datasets without duplicating code.
