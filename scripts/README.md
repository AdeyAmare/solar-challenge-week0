# Scripts Overview

The scripts folder contains reusable Python functions for data preparation and analysis. These scripts are designed to be modular and flexible, enabling users to:

1. Load raw and cleaned datasets.
2. Generate summary statistics and missing value reports.
3. Detect and handle outliers.
4. Clean and impute missing or anomalous data.
5. Create visualizations including time series plots, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, wind roses, and bubble charts.

By using these scripts, users can apply the same data processing and analysis workflow to multiple datasets without duplicating code.
